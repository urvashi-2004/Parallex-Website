Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special take off or a landing track. Paragliding is also the fastest developed air sport in the world.

The season is not very important for paragliding,  however if it is too windy, you shouldn’t do it.

            <p class="text">Rafting and whitewater rafting are outdoor entertainment activities that use a boat or an unsinkable raft. It has different difficulty levels according to the current of the water in which the sport is done. It can be done solo but is more commonly done with groups and needs good teamwork to manage the water. River rafting, canoeing and whitewater rafting are the most preferred styles of this sport.
            <br><br>
            March and April are the beginning of the rafting season and the water can be cold. Also, tours would be cheaper than other months. The summer season, which comes with May, is the period in which rafting tourism activities begin. As of this month, rafting training programs for children begin and it is quite enjoyable to do rafting in May. In summer rafting tourism peaks and these months are the most crowded times for rafting.
            It is recommended that the beginners try this sport in summer with rafting tours where you can find a guide. Every river has its own time for rafting so you should check information about the rafting location before you plan. </p>
